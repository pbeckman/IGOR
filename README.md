Improvement-based Global Optimization Routine

Package leveraging data from automatic differentiation to construct Gaussian process surrogates for objective and constraint functions for black-box optimization.

This repo is the basis for my thesis so be warned, it is currently under development and is unstable.

See taper_MLE.jl for a working test.
